## Political Preparedness App

App created for Udacity Nano Degree Project. Aims at increasing user political preparedness by providing a way to find the users representative based on location as well as providing a list of the upcoming elections with an option to save the election for ease of access. Calls Google Civics API for information on representatives and elections and allows saving them to local storage via Room database.
